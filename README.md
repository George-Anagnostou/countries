# Country Guesser

A simple site to practice some basic web skills and have a little fun learning about countries. The site currently features a list of all countries that is filterable by continent and sortable by name or population, as well as country and capital guessing games.

User accounts are currently in development so you can save your high scores. A leaderboard is soon to follow.
