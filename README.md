# Country Guesser

A simple site to practice some basic web skills and have a little fun learning about countries. The site currently features a list of all countries that is filterable by continent and sortable by name or population, as well as country and capital guessing games. Make an account to track your longest streak, and check out the leaderboard to see the best players!

This site is written in [`Go`](https://go.dev/) using the [`echo`](https://echo.labstack.com/) web framework with an [`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/) backend. No `Javascript` is used; the site is statically rendered with `Go's` standard [html template package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template).
